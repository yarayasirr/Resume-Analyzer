## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **File Upload**  
   Upload your resume in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format.

2. **Text Extraction & Cleaning**  
   - PDF â†’ `PyPDF2`  
   - DOCX â†’ `python-docx`  
   - TXT â†’ plain text with UTF-8 / Latin-1 fallback  
   - Cleaning using regex: remove URLs, special characters, extra spaces, and non-ASCII symbols.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   - Text is vectorized using **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).  
   - Optional: deep learning-based embeddings could be integrated for semantic understanding.

4. **Machine Learning Model**  
   - **Classifier:** `LinearSVC` wrapped in `OneVsRestClassifier` for multi-class classification.  
   - Model predicts job category based on vectorized resume text.  
   - Uses **label encoder** to map predicted numeric labels to category names.  

5. **Prediction & Confidence**  
   - If available, the model outputs **probability/confidence scores** for each category.  
   - Top category is displayed with confidence.

6. **Skill Extraction**  
   - Predefined key skills (e.g., Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Excel) are extracted and displayed.  
   - Can be extended with NLP-based Named Entity Recognition (NER).

7. **Downloadable Results**  
   - Results can be downloaded as CSV including predicted category, confidence, and detected skills.
